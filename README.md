# MIPS Single Cycle Processor - Fibonacci Series

## Overview

This project implements a single cycle MIPS processor using VHDL. The primary application of this processor is to compute the Fibonacci series.

## Features

- Written entirely in VHDL.
- Single-cycle architecture.
- Computes the Fibonacci series up to the nth term.

## Requirements

- FPGA development platform or VHDL simulator.
- Basic understanding of VHDL and MIPS architecture.
